Hello World,

This is Linkbub, I'm working on learning as many code languages as possible as quickly as I can. I want to learn front-end web-development to start followed by SQL, PHP, Ruby and anything else that I need to become a programmer.
I would like to be able to program my own andriod apps, make my own webpages, and program my own apps for Linux and Windows. I would also like to be able to develope and maintain my own servers.
I'm going to work on code everyday till I reach this goal.
